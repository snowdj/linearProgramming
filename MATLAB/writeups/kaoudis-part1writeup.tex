\section{Deliverable}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Part 1: pivotWithEtaFactors.m answering the following questions:
    \item $ \pi^T * B = c_B^T  $ when $ B = L * U * E1 * ... * En $
    \item $ B * \tilde{b} = b $
    \item $ B * \tilde{A_j} = -A_j $
    \item Find the new eta matrix to append to the basis factors.
        Build it using a sparse identity matrix with the leaving column replaced by $ -\tilde{A_j} $.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation}
I began with making sure I understood the revised
simplex algorithm, read Vanderbei's description,
but computing.dcu.ie/~lkillen/teach/CA427rsm.pdf
ended up being the most helpful description of it.
I re-watched the videos regarding revised
simplex to make sure I understood the
notation in the formulas above.

Then, I replaced every instance of a computation using Ab or Ab' with the eta file.

The last thing I did was to add the basis update: I add an eta-factor to the file which is a sparse identity
matrix except for $ \tilde{A_j} $, inserted in the column for the enteringIndex. According to testMyPivot, this
works as expected.
